	<h1>Understanding of Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>
		Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size.
		Analyzing time complexity helps us choose more efficient algorithms to solve problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution.
		A common example is O(n), which means the memory required grows linearly with the input size.
